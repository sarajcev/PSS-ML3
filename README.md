# Manifold learning in TSA
Manifold Learning in Power System Transient Stability Assessment (TSA)

Following **embedding** or dimmensionality reduction methods are examined:

* Principal components analysis
* Kernelized principal components analysis
* Truncated singular value decomposition
* Isomap embedding
* t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
* Locally linear embedding
* Modified locally linear embedding
* Locally linear embedding with local tangent space alignment algorithm
* Locally linear embedding with Hessian eigenmap method
* Spectral embedding
* Multi-dimensional scaling

**Supervised** and **unsupervised** training, using cross-validation with stratified shuffle split, with hyperparameters optimization tackled by means of the **simulating annealing** algorithm.

**Dataset** is derived from the extensive set of numerical electro-mechanical simulations of the IEEE New England 39-bus benchmark electric power system.
