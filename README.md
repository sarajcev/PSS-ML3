# PSS-ML3
Manifold Learning in Power System Transient Stability Assessment

Following embedding (or dimmensionality reduction) methods are examined:

* Principal components analysis
* Kernelized principal components analysis
* Truncated singular value decomposition
* Isomap embedding
* t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
* Locally linear embedding
* Modified locally linear embedding
* Locally linear embedding with local tangent space alignment algorithm
* Locally linear embedding with Hessian eigenmap method
* Spectral embedding
* Multi-dimensional scaling

Supervised and unsupervised training (cross-validation with stratified shuffle split), with hyperparameters optimization tackled by means of the **simulating annealing** algorithm.
